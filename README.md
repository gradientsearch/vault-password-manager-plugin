# üîê vault-plugin-secrets-pwmanager

This project creates a plugin that can be registered with `HashiCorp Vault`. The plugin is responsible for managing `pwmanager` user policies and user KV-V2 secret mounts, which store user passwords.

In addition to the plugin, a web client is provided to offer a user-friendly interface for interacting with the plugin‚Äôs password management capabilities. User passwords are encrypted client-side with a symmetric key before being sent to `HashiCorp Vault`. This ensures that if a `HashiCorp Vault` administrator views a user‚Äôs password, it will be encrypted. The user‚Äôs private key is stored in an encrypted bundle known as the User Unique Key (UUK). The UUK contains the necessary information to decrypt the user‚Äôs private key using a two-secret key derivation function. This private key can then decrypt the required keys for encrypting and decrypting data.
